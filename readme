In this certain project I want to create a passcode pin generator, that also allows you to enter in your own number combinations.

This application will take in a pin from a user and then It will check if that list follows the rules of the program, and those rules will be:
    1. cannot be a 1234
    2. should not be your birthday or any birth date of your family members

after the program checks these rules it will then either accept the pin or it will decline it

    if accepted:
        print("Pin Accepter")
    elif:
        input("Should I generate one for you? ")
        if input == 'Yes' or 'y' or 'Y'
            return random_num()
        else:
            break
    else:
        print('Not Acceptable. Try another combination')

So if the pin entered does not follow the rules, the program will either ask the user to try another combination, or it will ask the user if it should give them a random generated number

The application will only eccept 4 digits numbers
so 
    if len(numbers) != 4:
        print('Must be four digits')
